# Bookmarks

This web-application allows a user to manage a bookmark list. The user can add a new bookmark, view a list of all bookmarks grouped by group property, delete any bookmark from an existing list.

A new bookmark has 3 required fields. They are the name, the url and the group.
There are three groups. The group list is static intentionally because there is no requirement/description how the user should manage the bookmark group list.
